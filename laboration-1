The trailer fitted under the carport and behind a set of gates, so the dogs were very secure. You need be confident reversing a trailer but it is do-able. The backyard is pretty much secure, but if your dog was determined, I think it would manage to escape.  This place suited me for the 3 nights I stayed there. Leena was the perfect host and very easy for a first timer to deal with.   "

There is a huge backyard with a variety of flowers that attract colourful birds. I really enjoyed watching the sunset sitting in the huge entertainment deck.\n\nThere is easy access to the Sydney CBD via M7/M2. Shops, cafes and takeaway restaurants are just a few minutes walk away."

There are facilities to accommodate up to a dozen people.\n\nI was impressed with the immaculate presentation. It is very clean and nicely decorated. The well-lit kitchen has all the facilities that one requires for cooking. Just outside the kitchen is a huge entertainment deck for family get-togethers.\n\nThe place is located in a quiet, leafy street, where there is local traffic only and heaps of free parking. \n\nWithin 5 minutes walking distance, off James Cook Drive, is the Kings Langley shopping centre with Coles, Woolies, boutique shops, restaurants, cafes and takeaways.\n\nJust 3 minutes walk in the opposite direction, off Sunnyholt Road, are fast-food restaurants and specialty shops.\n\nVardy's T-Way bus stop is a 3-minute walk away with direct buses to Parramatta, Blacktown, Castle Hill, Hillsong Church and Rouse Hill.\n\nLess than 2 minutes drive away is M7. For Canberra, go west and bypass the city. Drive east to quickly get to Sydney CBD via M2 in an hour."
